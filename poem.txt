This is a poem, written in nano, for no particular purpose,
only to produce sounds, sounds of a keyboard chattering away in the 
background.

Why you may ask, nobody really know..

I'm wondering, though.

I'm mainly wondering how far people want to take this..
Would they like to see the text.

I'm not really sure if there is anyhing to see.

Maybe it does not really matter anyway. Maybe the chattering is enough..

Maybe it is all they need...
Maybe nobody will ever play the game anyway..

Maybe nobody will believe that this very textfile.. POTATO..
Was actually written just to create sounds...
But it was, and well, another thing..

Coffee is good. :)

Hehe, well.. I'm wondering how long it would take for the uninitiated to 
complete the game, I'd rather that the soundtrack is long enough..

Maybe I should aim for 10 minutes.. 10 minutes is a lot of text, but..
At this time of night, there are many rewordings, and many typos, so 
I'll not produce as much text as it sounds like... :)

Strange pauses too..
Hm, maybe 5 minutes would be acceptable..
I mean really, you'd have to be crazy to play the game for more than 5 
minutes ? No ?
Hmm, maybe not, it'd be interesting to watch someone play it just to see
how they do, if they figure out the combination, it's really the only 
way out, and I suppose nobody could really get that lost..

Maybe I should have put in a loop, so that people could (unknowlingly) 
reset the state of the game, and would have to start all over, that 
would be quite evil I think :)

Hmm, how is it now?  Nearing 5 minutes.. Very close.. Running out of 
things to write.. I wonder what more there is.,

Maybe some nice short words that I can write very fast..
Pipopiaa... now wait,t hat is actually sCHlower..
 Hehe..

Now the 5 minutes have gone, I'll shut down nano and stop audacity from 
recording any more of this nonsense.. :)
